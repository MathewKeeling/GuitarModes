# GuitarModes
Blending my passion for guitar with my desire to learn software development.

## Overview
When I played guitar as a kid I fundamentally didn't understand the way modes / positions of the major scale worked.

Recently, I have been learning music theory. I am understanding things a lot more clearly now.

I want to make an app that helps with recall for various aspects of guitar playing...

Visualization of the fret board w/ different tunings.

CAGED review, modes and positions, etc.

We'll see where this goes.

## Plans
First I want to establish a way to generate a fretboard in plaintext that reflects a theoretical fretboard.

I would then like to dynamically emphasize different notes corresponding to different music theory concepts.

The goal is to create something that is interactive and/or demonstrative for learning purposes.

### Examples:
* What's a full tone higher than a C note?
* To which major or minor scale does C Locrian belong?
* To which scale does the following sequence of notes belong? 
 * C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
* The highlighted notes belong to which scale?
* The highlighted notes belong to which mode?
* What are the notes of the C Dorian Mode?
