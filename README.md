# GuitarModes
Blending my passion for guitar with my desire to learn software development.

## Overview
When I played guitar as a kid I fundamentally didn't understand the way modes / positions of the major scale worked.

Recently, I have been learning music theory. I am understanding things a lot more clearly now.

I want to make an app that helps with recall for various aspects of guitar playing...

Visualization of the fret board w/ different tunings.

CAGED review, modes and positions, etc.

We'll see where this goes.
